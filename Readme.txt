This a music sharing application.
It allows the user to listen to music and share it as well. Each user may create an account that allows them to customize preferences.
While not being authenticated, a user can browse music (via an search box -> input form) online, view the results in a list and also listen to a selected song.
In case a user logs in, they can also decide to download each song to their phones, making them available offline as well. 
Logging in also offers the option to share a song on social media (such as facebook, twitter or google+)
Users also can look at statics (which artist is the most popular, which song is the most popular, which genre is the most popular).
